# Securing-Data-with-Image-Encryption-Using-AES-Algorithm

# Overview

This project presents a robust method for securing data through the integration of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with steganography. The approach involves encrypting textual data using AES and then covertly embedding the encrypted text within images, providing a dual layer of security for sensitive information during storage and transmission.

# Motivation

The increasing complexity and frequency of cyber threats necessitate innovative solutions for data protection. Traditional encryption methods, while effective, can be vulnerable if encryption keys are discovered. By combining AES encryption with steganography, this project aims to enhance data security, ensuring that even if the encryption is detected, the data remains protected through covert embedding within images.

# Problem Statement

The primary goal is to develop an efficient and secure method for encrypting textual data and embedding it within images. The challenge lies in designing a process that guarantees data confidentiality and imperceptibility while managing encryption keys securely for accurate decryption.

# Objectives

1. **Develop Robust AES Encryption**: Implement a strong AES encryption algorithm to transform textual data into ciphertext.
2. **Embed Encrypted Text**: Create an efficient process to covertly embed the encrypted text within image files, ensuring that the presence of hidden data is not easily detectable.
3. **Ensure Secure Key Management**: Emphasize secure handling and management of encryption keys to enable accurate decryption and retrieval of hidden data.

# Scope

The project focuses on:
- Implementing an AES-encrypted text hiding mechanism within images.
- Exploring covert communication techniques to ensure imperceptibility.
- Addressing the balance between security, efficiency, and key management in cryptographic image hiding.
